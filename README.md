# Todo
- [ ] Format chemical equations with KaTeX
- [ ] Make a type for elements
- [ ] Change the names of the molecules if the student changes the subscript (i.e. water changes to hydrogen peroxide)
- [ ] Pull down molecules graphically to balance the equation
- [x] Alternatively, change the coefficient for symbolic manipulation
    - [ ] Let the appropriate number of graphical molecules automatically appear
- [x] Keep track of the total number of elements on each side
- [x] Keep track of what imbalanced elements need to be compensated for (i.e. "You need to have 4 more hydrogen in the result for the equation to balance.")
    - [ ] Show this graphically (see paint picture)
- [x] Change "List" to a better name in the Molecule type
- [ ] Find balancing equation examples
    - [ ] Make a list of equations (H_2 O_2 -> H_2O) (Fe_6 ?? )
    - [ ] Make the game loop where you pull a random equation, the student balances it, then plays again ("New Equation")
    - [ ] Don't "Play Again" and get the same equation twice
- [ ] Graphically represent imbalances better
