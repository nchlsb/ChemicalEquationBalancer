# Todo
- [ ] Format chemical equations with KaTeX
- [ ] Make a type for elements
- [ ] Change the names of the molecules if the student changes the subscript (i.e. water changes to hydrogen peroxide)
- [ ] Pull down molecules graphically to balance the equation
- [ ] Alternatively, change the coefficient for symbolic manipulation (and let the appropriate number of graphical molecules automatically appear)
- [x] Keep track of the total number of elements on each side
- [ ] Keep track of what "overflow" elements need to be compensated for (i.e. "You need to have 4 more hydrogen in the result for the equation to balance.")
- [x] Change "List" to a better name in the Molecule type
- [ ] Find balancing equation examples
