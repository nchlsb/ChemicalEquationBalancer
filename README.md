# Todo
- [X] Format chemical equations with KaTeX
- [X] Make a type for elements
- [ ] Change the names of the molecules if the student changes the subscript (i.e. water changes to hydrogen peroxide)
- [ ] Pull down molecules graphically to balance the equation
- [x] Alternatively, change the coefficient for symbolic manipulation
    - [ ] Let the appropriate number of graphical molecules automatically appear
- [x] Keep track of the total number of elements on each side
- [x] Keep track of what imbalanced elements need to be compensated for (i.e. "You need to have 4 more hydrogen in the result for the equation to balance.")
    - [x] Show this graphically (see paint picture)
- [x] Change "List" to a better name in the Molecule type
- [ ] Find balancing equation examples
    - [x] Make a list of equations (H_2 O_2 -> H_2O) (Fe_6 ?? )
    - [ ] Make the game loop where you pull a random equation, the student balances it, then plays again ("New Equation")
    - [ ] Don't "Play Again" and get the same equation twice
    - [ ] Catagorize into easy and hard
- [x] Graphically represent imbalances better
- [x] Implement isBalanced() (again) using the new Map type
- [ ] Which bar is the reactants, and which is the products?
    - [x] (try the "Spread Wing" style)
    - [ ] Change the color of the specific bar when it's balanced (when a       particular molecule is balanced)
- [ ] Sort elements by atomic weight (and implement atomic weight function)
- [ ] The "spread wing" bars are always the same length on either side. Is that redundant
      information a problem?
- [ ] Solve the styling issue where the --> is not in the center of the screen
- [ ] Remove the magic number 20 / replace as a constant, or remove completely somehow (using screen percentages, i.e., the largest bar always stretches to the end of the screen)
- [ ] Rename alignRight and alignCenter classes
